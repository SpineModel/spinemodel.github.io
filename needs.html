<p>There are two different aspects of Needs - the needs of the system itself, and the needs of the individuals within the system.</p>

<p>
Answers the question: <i>The system exists in order that ______ ...</i>
</p>


<h2>System Level</h2>
<p>Why does this system exist? Wherever you choose to draw the boundaries of the system in question (team, department, value stream, etc), you should answer this question through the eyes of its owners or sponsors. What need do they hope to have met by sponsoring and supporting this system? How does it support the greater need of the system of which it is a part?</p>

<h2>Individual Level</h2>
<p>At an <i>individual</i> level, what needs does each person hope to have met through being a part of this system?</p>

<p>Remember that you can not <i>give</i> people needs, you can only align their strategies for meeting them to each the other people in the system, and the greater need of the system itself.</p>
