Core working hours are the block of hours in which the members of the team agree to be working as a team every working day. It is useful to get upfront agreement on when these are to ensure that the team has productive working time together.


## What Core Working Hours means me (by Danie Roux)
Core Working Hours used to *mean* something. I realise that this makes
me sound like an extremely old man, but let me explain:

During the core working hours, we were productive. We produced something of value to the team and company. Things that weren’t considered ‘adding value’ were e-mails, meetings, taking calls and fielding interruptions.

In order to ensure we were productive and adding value during core working hours, we closed our office doors, turned off our cell phones, unplugged the office phones and closed the instant messaging applications. Then we tackled the work in front of us with gusto.

That is what we mean by Core *Working* Hours. The hours the team agree to be together, working.
