# Primary Principles
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* [Individuals and interactions over processes and tools](principle-agile-individualsandinteractions)
* [Working software over comprehensive documentation](principle-agile-workingsoftware)
* [Customer collaboration over contract negotiation](principle-agile-customercollaboration)
* [Responding to change over following a plan](principle-agile-respondingtochange)

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

# Additional 12 Principles

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
