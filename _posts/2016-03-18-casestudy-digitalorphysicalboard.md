A team needed to choose between a digital or a physical team board to track their work (a [Tool](/tools) decision). This team needed to deliver software features early and incrementally to a customer with uncertain requirements.

They created this prototype Spine Map:

| Level | Description |
|-------|--------|
| **Needs** | Deliver software features early and incrementally to a customer with uncertain requirements. |
| **Values** | Feedback, Communication, Flow |
| **Principles** | Prefer higher bandwidth communication, Deploy the most valuable capabilities first, Visualise the flow of work, Minimise batch size, limit WIP, Pull work |
| **Practices**  | Co-location, Face to face communication wherever possible, Daily Standup, Story Mapping, Team Board, Visual WIP limits |
| **Tools**      |  *Physical team board or digital team board?* |

Based on the fact that the team was co-located, wanted to encourage face to face communication and would like to have a daily stand up meeting it would seem that a physical board would support these [Practices](/practices) better, so that is where they  started experimenting.
