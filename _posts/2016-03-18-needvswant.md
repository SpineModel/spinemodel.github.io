In the context of the Spine Model, "wants" are strategies for meeting [Needs](/Needs.html). Often we are not conciously aware of this. By asking why you want that thing or outcome you can start to explore the underlying need.

As an example, you possibly think of money as a basic need. It isn't, it is a "want" - a strategy for meeting deeper needs. By looking for answers to the question "Once you have enough money, what would you have?", you can start to get to the underlying needs. Possibly they may include saftey, comfort or self expression.
