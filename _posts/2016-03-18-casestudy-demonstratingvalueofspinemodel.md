## Context

I was given a 10 minute slot at a local developer community event to introduce and explain the Spine model. Before I prepared the talk I made a quick spine of what I would like to achieve.

## Talk Spine

| Level | Description |
|-------|--------|
| **Needs** | Demonstrate the value of the Spine Model |
| **Values** | Simplicity, Practicality |
| **Principles** | Know your audience, Less is more, Cut down on text, Use metaphor, Multiple examples |
| **Practices** | Test first approach, Talk through slide deck |
| **Tools** | Mac, Connector, Keynote slides, Projector, Voice |

## Outcome

It helped me focus on what was important, I changed and stripped down a number of slides and focussed on the key message. I'm not a natural public speaker, so doing this was very helpful to me. Next time I will add "Maintain eye contact" as a Practice.
