## Origin
The term XP predates the term Agile by several years. XP stands for Extreme Programming, and is a suite of Practices, Principles, and Values invented by [Kent Beck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) in the late â€˜90s.

## Needs
Extreme programming is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.
