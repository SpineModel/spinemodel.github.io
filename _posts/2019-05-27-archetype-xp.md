# Origin
Although widely considered an Agile approach, XP predates the term "Agile" by several years. XP stands for Extreme Programming, and is a suite of Practices, Principles, and Values invented by [Kent Beck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) in the late ‘90s.

# XP Spine
**From the perspective of prospective users of eXtreme Programming...**

## Need (Where might it be used?)
Extreme Programming is a discipline of software development based on values of simplicity, communication, feedback, courage, and respect. It works by bringing the whole team together in the presence of simple practices, with enough feedback to enable the team to see where they are and to tune the practices to their unique situation.
