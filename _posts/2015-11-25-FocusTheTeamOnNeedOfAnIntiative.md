## Context

I ()


## Pilot Spine

* Need
  * How can we measure and understand team productivity (instead of individual effort)?
  * Can we satisfy the current charge-back accounting model whilst doing this?

* Values
  * Visibility
  * Transparency

* Principles
  * Estimate in size, derive duration.
  * Measure team throughput not individual input.
  * Shared definition of "Done" across the whole team.

* Practices
  * Estimate story points before starting a story, and then again once it is completed.
  * Team review of pre vs post point estimates to see what can be learned.
  * Iteration + Backlog burn charts

* Tools
  * Jira
  * Confluence Wiki (to record learnings)

## Outcome

The team is now focused on the Need and is experimenting with different ways they can tweak the practices and tooling to make them more valuable to the team, whilst still satisfying the higher level need of management.
