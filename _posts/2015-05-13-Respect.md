## As defined in [eXtreme Programming (XP)](/Archetype/XP/)
Everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member. Everyone contributes value even if it's simply enthusiasm. Developers respect the expertise of the customers and vice versa. Management respects our right to accept responsibility and receive authority over our own work.

## As defined in [SCRUM](/Archetype/SCRUM/)
As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.
