Heuristics are rules of thumb. They are generally true, but there can be exceptions in certain contexts, so they are more flexible than rules.

[System](what-is-a-system) boundaries can be put in place by providing heuristic rules to govern a particular principle.

For example we often use these three for teams:

* **Increase** [feedback](value-xp-feedback)
* **Decrease** batch size
* **Pull** work through the system

This does not tell teams what [Practices] to use, however they can be measured against whether or not they are applying the [Principles] in a desirable way - which is a big advantage over hard rules.

See the [Path to Mastering Skills](guide-your-path-to-mastering-skills) article for more some more in depth exploration of when heuristics are appropriate.
