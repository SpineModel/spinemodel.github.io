This example shows how a team might go about choosing to use a digital or a physical team board to track their work (a [Tool](/Tools.html) descision). It assumes, for this example that it is a team that needs to deliver software features early and incrementally to a customer with uncertain requirements.

Based on the fact that the team is co-located, want to encourage face to face communication and would like to have a daily stand up meeting it would seem that a physical board would support these [Practices](/Practices.html) better, so that is where they should start experimenting...
