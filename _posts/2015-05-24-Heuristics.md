[System](/faq/WhatIsASystem) boundaries can be put in place by providing heuristic rules to govern a particular principle.

People tend to remember heuristic better when they come in threes. For example we often use these three for teams:

* **Increase** [feedback](/value/feedback)
* **Decrease** [batch size](/principle/batchsize) 
* **Pull** [work through the system](/principle/pullworkthroughthesystem)

This does not tell teams what [Practices](/practices.html) to use, however they can be measured against whether or not they are applying the [Principles](/principles.html) in a desirable way.

See the [Path to Agile Mastery](/faq/PathToAgileMastery) FAQ article for more some more in depth exploration of when heuristics are appropriate.
