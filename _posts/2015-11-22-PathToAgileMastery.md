It is useful to look at an aspect of the [Dreyfus Model of Skills Acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) to answer this question. An important point to make up-front is that this is a per-skill model, not a per-person model:

As you can see from the model, as a person progresses from Novice to Expert for a given skill, the basis for taking action shifts from needing rules and routines to reading the context and responding intuitively.

When you apply this knowledge to the Spine Model you can see that it is possible to define rule based action at a [Tools](/tools.html) and [Practices](/practices.html) level, but when you get above that to [Principles](/principles.html) and [Values](/values.html) a much larger amount of contextual understanding is required in order to determine the right actions.

So, for people new to an Agile approach (Novices), they should be provided with enough rules in order for them to take appropriate action (eg [Scrum](/architype/Scrum)). However, if those rules are not linked to Principles and Values that meet Needs, the person will be hampered in their progression on the Novice to Master spectrum. 

Additionally, a person that has progressed on the spectrum will feel constrained by those same rules that the Novice requires. For these people, [heuristics](/explanation/Heuristics) based on Principles are a more appropriate way of creating directive boundaries and enabling constraints.

A coherent Spine Model approach would take the Dreyfus Model into account when formulating a journey to mastering Agile.
