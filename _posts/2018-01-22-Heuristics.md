[System](/faq/WhatIsASystem.html) boundaries can be put in place by providing heuristic rules to govern a particular principle.

People tend to remember heuristic better when they come in threes. For example we often use these three for teams (links go to the [spine.wiki](http://spine.wiki)):

* **Increase** [feedback](http://spine.wiki/value/Feedback)
* **Decrease** [batch size](http://spine.wiki/principle/BatchSize) 
* **Pull** [work through the system](http://spine.wiki/principle/PullWorkThroughTheSystem)

This does not tell teams what [Practices](/practices.html) to use, however they can be measured against whether or not they are applying the [Principles](/principles.html) in a desirable way.

See the [Path to Agile Mastery](/usage/guideyourpathtomasteringskills) FAQ article for more some more in depth exploration of when heuristics are appropriate.
