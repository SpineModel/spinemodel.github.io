## Context

I was given a 10 minute slot at a local developer community event to introduce and explain the Spine model. Before I prepared the talk I made a quick spine of what I would like to achieve.

## Talk Spine

* Need
  * **Demonstrate the value of the Spine Model**
* Values
  * Simplicity
  * Practicality
* Principles
  * Know your audience
  * Less is more
  * Cut down on text
  * Use metaphor
  * Multiple examples.
* Practices
  * Test first approach
  * Talk through slide deck
* Tools
  * Mac
  * Connector
  * Keynote slides
  * Projector
  * Voice

## Outcome

It helped me focus on what was important, I changed and stripped down a number of slides and focussed on the key message. I'm not a great public speaker, so doing this was very helpful to me. Next time I will add "Maintain eye contact" as a Practice.
