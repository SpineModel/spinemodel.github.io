## As defined in [eXtreme Programming (XP)](/Prototype/XP/)
We will tell the truth about progress and estimates. We don't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed. We don't fear anything because no one ever works alone. We will adapt to changes when ever they happen.

## As defined in [SCRUM](/Prototype/SCRUM/)
Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges.
