Extreme Programming teams are in it for the long term. They work hard, and at a pace that can be sustained indefinitely. This means that they work overtime when it is effective, and that they normally work in such a way as to maximize productivity week in and week out. Itâ€™s pretty well understood these days that death march projects are neither productive nor produce quality software. XP teams are in it to win, not to die.
