The Spine model emerged from coaching and mentoring in teams that produce software. This means that many of the [Practices] and [Tools] relate directly to teams that work in the context of software development. 

So what about teams that don't build software? Is Spine Model still applicable?

## Short answer

**Yes, definitely.** The model is applicable to any system of human relationships in general, and to human work systems in particular.

## Longer Answer

In the context of human work systems one of the key constraints of software development is that it is *mental* labour, not *manual* labour. The fact that you are actually designing software only really matters at the Practices and Tools levels. At a [Principles] level, all mental labour will adhere to similar Principles. At a [Values] and [Needs] level it becomes less about the nature of the work and more the nature of humans.
