## What is it?  
A visible list of all the things the team may want to dig deeper into during their next [Retrospective](/practice/TeamRetrospective/).

## Why use it?
If a challenge or opportunity is uncovered around how the team gets the work done, individuals may feel they want to dig deeper into understanding it during the next Retro. There is a risk that you could forget what it was, or not spend enough time deliberating on it, so making it visible in the team space is a useful way of making sure it doesn't slip through.

## When to use it?
Any time a challenge or opportunity is uncovered and the team doesn't feel it is appropriate to address it right there and then.

## What could it look like?
It could be an area or piece of paper on a team's board. Somewhere highly visible. 

## Assumptions
The team does not use this list as a way of avoiding difficult conversations that should be had sooner.
