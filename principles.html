<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>
<p>Can best be described as &quot;ecological levers&quot;. They are the switches and dials that you can use to effect a desired change to a system. They are the universal truths and rules that govern the behaviours of all human organisational systems.</p>
<h2 id="heuristics">Heuristics</h2>
<p>System boundaries can be put in place by providing heuristic rules to govern a particular principle.</p>
<p>People tend to remember heuristic better when they come in threes. For example we often use these three for teams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase</strong> feedback [TODO: link to feedback principle]</li>
<li><strong>Decrease</strong> batch size (see <a href="principles/batch-size.html">Batch size</a> principle)</li>
<li><strong>Pull</strong> work through the system [TODO: link to push-vs-pull principle]</li>
</ul>
<p>This does not tell teams what practices to use, however they can be measured against whether or not they are applying the principles in a desirable way.</p>
