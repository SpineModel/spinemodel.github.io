<p><b>Archetype (n): </b> The original pattern or model from which all things of the same kind are copied or on which they are based.</p>

<p>
Many attempts have been made to provide patterns, models and frameworks for "How the work works". Extracting their respective documentation and manifestos into the five levels of a spine, these can be mapped using the Spine Model.

<p>
This makes them easier to understand and to start to compare to each other. It also makes them easier to use as a departure point and effectively evolve to suit your specific context.
