# The Spine Model

Going through life with a crooked spine is not a pleasant experience. Groups of people also have a spine - the organisational system that holds them together and defines how they interact and behave towards each other. Unfortunately many teams and organisations don't even know that their spine is far from straight.

The Spine Model gives a new way of thinking about human organisational systems. It allows you to map the system you are in and compare different systems in a useful way.

# What is it?

We refer to it as a meta-model for human organisational systems. More simply, it is a way of creating or mapping existing systems such as a team, department or even whole organisation.

It is based on a chain of levels that can be thought of as vertebrae of a spine:

* Needs
* Values
* Principles
* [Practices]
* Tools

# Why is it useful?

The structure of a human organisational system can be either implicit or explicit. By making the structure explicit, starting at the reason the system exists in the first place "Needs", your chances of having a well functioning system are greatly enhanced.

You can use Spine to deepen understanding of how human systems work, resolve unhealthy conflict and generate new insights.

Bits:
There are many schools of thought about how best to organise groups of people. We need a way to usefully compare these different approaches and to decide which of them, or which parts are useful in a specific context.
