> Answers the question: *We leverage _____ to maintain or change the system...*

It is important to understand how human work systems behave and Principles are the route to doing so. Principles are those things behind the Practices. Every Practice comes into existence because it tries to express a set of Principles.

Principles are the cause-effect dynamics by which a human work system behaves. They are inherent to the system. They are something you can discover, but not make up.

Principles can be thought of as "ecological levers" - switches and dials that you believe you can use to effect a desired change to a system. You can do this by establishing [governing heuristics](/explanation/Heuristics) which guide people and can be used as a measurement of adherence. 

Unlike [Practices](/practices.html), Principles are often fractal in nature, applying equally at various levels of the [system](/faq/WhatIsASystem). For example, principles around batch size are typically equally applicable to an individual, an organsation and even an industry. We know that if you increase batch size you delay feedback. If you reduce batch size you increase feedback. This principle remains true regardless of the context or scale of the human work system.

Useful systemic principles can be extracted from many different schools of thought - Queuing Theory, Complexity Science and Theory of Constraints to name just three.

When applying the Spine Model, you need understand which Principles are important in your context so that you make sure you can leverage them. You also need to be able to uncover and debate the Principles on which other people are basing their assumptions.
