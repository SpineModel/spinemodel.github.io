# Abstract
Great people, great ideas, great work environment. Often all the ingredients are there, but somehow there always seems to be fires to put out, misunderstanding to smooth over, damage to be undone. 

Being an effective leader is hard when there is just so much to be done all the time.

As a leader in an organisation you are only effective when there is a shared perception of the way things currently are and productive debate on the way they should be. An effective leader makes it clear where the boundaries are and empowers people to make choices within them. Without an effective mental model of your work system that is easily shared with others this becomes an intractable problem that consumes your energy as well as that of all those who look to you for direction.

**The Spine Model** is a systemic approach to mapping a work system that will enable you to be a more effective leader. It provides an explicit way to determine your responsibilities as a leader and those that should be delegated to the people doing the work. It shows how and where to place enabling constraints into a work system that will allow the people most familiar with the current local context to decide how that work should be done.

The Spine Model has emerged from our coaching through necessity rather than intent. We have been applying and refining it for some time and, recently, teaching it to others. We have found that it meets a large need, particularly for people that have started to move beyond basics of Scrum and Agile practices.

# Learning Outcomes

The session will show you how to apply the Spine Model to:

- Create and maintain a shared perception of how things are, and why.
- Lift conversations to an effective level, breaking agreement deadlocks.
- As a leader, place enabling constraints into the system and know when to intervene effectively.

# Prerequisite Knowledge
None. Some experience with the typical challenges faced by teams and organisations who adopt Agile methods would be beneficial.

# Information for Program Team
Kevin and Danie have both been working in agile environments for over a decade. We have been pair-coaching teams for the last 18 months. Prior to collaborating we both gained deep experience as technical coaches, coming from software development backgrounds having worked in (predominantly) XP and (some) Scrum teams. Kevin is founder of one of the leading agile development consultancies in South Africa.

We have started documenting some of the Spine Model here:
http://spine.wiki

In one of the presentations of the Spine Model we used the frame of "parenting" as an allegory of agile. We handed out a set of "parenting practices" to groups of people, deliberately crafted to create conflict. From there we "walked up" the Spine to a "parenting principle" that the group could agree on. We then quickly agreed on the needs and the values of a "parenting system".

Using this experience, we mapped that to "agile practices" that typically create conflict. Finding people in the audience that are actively in disagreement helped to illustrate how to "go up" the Spine to a principle that everyone could agree with.

At this time it became apparent to those attending the presentation that setting the principles and aligning with the needs and values of the system allowed for two very different practices to be used, each in the context to which it applied.

We plan to use the session time as follows:

(5 min) Opening and introduction
(30 min) An introduction to the Spine Model and it's mechanics
(20 min) How leaders apply the model practically
(20 min) De-brief, discussion, shared ideas
