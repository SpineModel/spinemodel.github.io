# Abstract
When deciding how work should be done in organizations people are frequently caught in a dilemma where equally plausible practices are available. Lines get drawn, sides get chosen and the conversations become undecidable arguments.

To address deadlocks, power hierarchies are enforced. Energy is wasted on reporting lines. Dotted lines are drawn. Accountable but not responsible is assigned. Responsible but not accountable is handed out.

The arguments escalate to the right or wrong dotted or solid lines - but the work doesn't get done.

There is a better way to have these conversations.

In this session we will demonstrate - in a workshop format - how to practically apply the "Spine Model" to have *effective conversations* in conflict situations.

Effective conversations lead to effective collaboration. With effective collaboration the energy wasted in *controlling* a work system can be applied to *doing great work*.

**The Spine Model** is a systemic approach to mapping a work system that will enable you to be a more effective leader in your work environment.

The Spine Model has emerged from our coaching through necessity rather than intent. We have been applying and refining it for some time. Recently we've been teaching it to others. We have found that it meets a large need, particularly for people that have started to move beyond basics of prescribed Agile methodologies.

# Learning Outcomes

The session will show you how to...

Create and maintain a shared perception of how things are, and why.
Lift conversations to an effective level, breaking agreement deadlocks.
Lead through influence rather than authority, no matter where you are in your organisation.
Practically create and apply a Spine Model.

# Prerequisite Knowledge
None. Some experience with the typical challenges faced by teams and organisations who adopt Agile methods would be beneficial.

# Information for Program Team
Kevin and Danie have both been working in agile environments for over a decade. We have been pair-coaching teams for the last 18 months. Prior to collaborating we both gained deep experience as technical coaches, coming from software development backgrounds having worked in (predominantly) XP and (some) Scrum teams. Kevin is founder of one of the leading agile development consultancies in South Africa.

We have started documenting some of the Spine Model here:
http://spine.wiki

In one of the presentations of the Spine Model we used the frame of "parenting" as an allegory of agile. We handed out a set of "parenting practices" to groups of people, deliberately crafted to create conflict. From there we "walked up" the Spine to a "parenting principle" that the group could agree on. We then quickly agreed on the needs and the values of a "parenting system".

Using this experience, we mapped that to "agile practices" that typically create conflict. Finding people in the audience that are actively in disagreement helped to illustrate how to "go up" the Spine to a principle that everyone could agree with.

At this time it became apparent to those attending the presentation that setting the principles and aligning with the needs and values of the system allowed for two very different practices to be used, each in the context to which it applied.

We plan to use the session time as follows:

(5 min) Opening and introduction
(30 min) An introduction to the Spine Model and it's mechanics
(20 min) How leaders apply the model practically
(20 min) De-brief, discussion, shared ideas
