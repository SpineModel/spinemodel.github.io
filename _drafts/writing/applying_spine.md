# Introduction

Spine is a fractal model, meaning that it can be applied to something as fine grained as a single meeting, or as large as an entire organisation. 

There are two modes of application. *System Spine*, or a *Personal Spine, within a System*.

The purpose of a System Spine is to either draw out the current implicit system patterns and make them explicit, or else to create an intentional model of the desired system patterns in the future. If the goal is that the System Spine is embraced and maintained effectively by the people inside the System it is preferable that they are involved in it's creation as early as possible. An initial version may however need to be drafted in order to identify those people and create a departure point.

The purpose of a Personal Spine is to express what is important to an individual within a specific System. It is important that the Personal Spine is in the context of specific system because our identity shifts based on context. We are not the same people at home as we are at work, or at our parents house. A Personal Spine makes explicit why we are a part of this System, what we hope to gain from participation and what will allow us to engage and what will cause us to withdraw.

**If you are new to the Spine Model it is preferable to work with an experienced facilitator who can guide you through the process.**

# How to create a System Spine

## 1. Identify NEEDS
###Step 1, Define the System boundary
###Step 2, What Systems is this System a part of?
###Step 3, What is the purpose of this part? 
What need(s) is it intended to provide for the containing systems?
Step 3.1 is it fit for purpose? (Digress)
###Step 4 Who are the people inside this system? 
What needs do they expect to be met by being a part of this system?

## 3. Identify PRINCIPLES

## 5. Identify TOOLS

# How to create a Personal Spine
## 1. Identify NEEDS

## 2. Identify VALUES
What are the personal Values that are important to you? The rest of the people in the system need to know what they are. They need to know how to honour those Values for you. What is going to allow you to be a part of the system? What is going to cause you to check out?
