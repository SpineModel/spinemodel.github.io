<p><img style="float: right; border: 30px solid white" src="images/spine.png"></p>
<p>The model is used to map human organisational systems. Once you have mapped a system you can...</p>
<ul>
<li>think about it in a far more useful way</li>
<li>generate new insights about why things are the way they are</li>
<li>make explicit and intentional changes</li>
<li>resolve unhealthy conflict</li>
<li>measure it</li>
<li>compare different systems</li>
</ul>
<p><br> Any system that requires humans to do work can be effectively mapped - most commonly this is done at a team level, however the model can be applied to a system boundary as narrow as a single meeting, or as wide as an entire organisation.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Before you can know which Tools to use, you need to decide what Practices are important.</li>
<li>Before you can know which Practices are important, you need to know which Principles apply.</li>
<li>Before you can know which Principles apply, you need to know what Values you are optimising for.</li>
<li>Before you can know which Values are important to optimise for, you need to know what Needs the system exists to satisfy.</li>
<li>Before you can know which Needs are important to satisfy, you need to define the boundaries of the system you talking about.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="definition-of-terms">Definition of Terms:</h2>
<p><strong>Needs</strong> - Firstly, at a system level, through the eyes of its creators, owners or sponsors, why does this system exist? Secondly, at an individual level, what needs I hope to have met through being a part of this system?</p>
<p>Answers the question: <em>The system exists in order that ______ .</em></p>
<p><strong>Values</strong> - Firstly, at a system level, if you have these things you are most likely to meet the Need. Secondly, at a personal level, these are the things that will keep me in the system.</p>
<p>Answers the question: <em>We optimise the system for ______.</em></p>
<p><strong>Principles</strong> - These are the cause-effect dynamics by which we believe the system behaves, and how we will take advantage of them.</p>
<p>Answers the question: <em>We leverage _____ to maintain or change the system.</em></p>
<p><strong>Practices</strong> - These are the concrete activities we use to get the work done.</p>
<p>Answers the question: <em>We do _____ to create or increase value.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tools</strong> - These are the automations and mechanisations that make the work easier to do.</p>
<p>Answers the question: <em>We use _____ to get the work done more efficiently.</em></p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples:</h2>
<p><strong>Needs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Organisational level: We make money</li>
<li>Team level: We ensure a particular service is supplied.</li>
<li>Individual level: We satisfy my need for self-expression.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Values</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Feedback</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Respect</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Principles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Batch Size - Decreasing batch sizes of completed work increase the regularity of feedback.</li>
<li>Work in Progress - By limiting work in progress to the capacity of the system we increase throughput</li>
<li>Flexible boundaries - Prefer heuristics over hard rules</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daily Stand Up meetings</li>
<li>Annual performance reviews</li>
<li>Lunch hour</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Email</li>
<li>JIRA</li>
<li>CRM</li>
</ul>
