<h1 id="the-spine-model">The Spine Model</h1>
<p>The model is used to map human organisational systems. Once you have mapped a system you can...</p>
<ul>
<li>think about it in a far more useful way</li>
<li>generate new insights about why things are the way they are</li>
<li>make explicit and intentional changes</li>
<li>resolve unhealthy conflict</li>
<li>measure it</li>
<li>compare different systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Any system that requires humans to do work can be effectively mapped - most commonly this is done at a team level, however the model can be applied to a system boundary as narrow as a single meeting, or as wide as an entire organisation.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h1>
<p>Based on a chain of levels, the model that can be thought of as vertebrae of a spine:</p>
<p>--{ <a href="needs.html">Needs</a> }-- <br> --{ <a href="values.html">Values</a> }-- <br> --{ <a href="principles.html">Principles</a> }-- <br> --{ <a href="practices.html">[Practices]</a> }-- <br> --{ <a href="tools.html">Tools</a> }--</p>
<p>You always measure against the highest level. The higher levels should set the frame for what is acceptable lower down (e.g. does this practice <em>satisfy</em> all the higher levels?).</p>
<p>So, the higher levels sets the bounds in which creativity can foster.</p>
<h1 id="why-is-it-useful">Why is it useful?</h1>
<p>The structure of a human organisational system can be either implicit or explicit. By making the structure explicit, starting at the reason the system exists in the first place &quot;Needs&quot;, your chances of having a well functioning system are greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>By mapping a system you create an opportunity for useful conversations to occur, and actions to be chosen that are ecologically appropriate for the system.</p>
