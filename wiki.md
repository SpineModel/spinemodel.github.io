There are two sites dedicated to the Spine Model. The first is this one, which tries to explain the model and show how it can, and is being applied. The second is the [Spine Wiki](http://spine.wiki).

The purpose of the wiki is to catalog community contributions of [Needs](http://spine.wiki/needs.html), [Values](http://spine.wiki/values.html), [Principles](http://spine.wiki/principles.html), [Practices](http://spine.wiki/practices.html) and [Tools](http://spine.wiki/tools.html) that they have identified or applied in their environments. It is hoped that through sharing these other people will be able to learn and identify or apply them as well.

You can find it at [Spine.wiki](http://spine.wiki). 

If you'd like to contribute, head directly [here](http://spine.wiki/faq/Contribute/).
