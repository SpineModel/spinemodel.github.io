## System Level
Why does this system exist? Wherever you choose to draw the boundaries of the system in question (team, department, value stream, etc), you should answer this question through the eyes of its owners or sponsors. What is this system a part of? What is it's purpose in the bigger system? In other words, how does it support the greater need of the system of which it is a part?
