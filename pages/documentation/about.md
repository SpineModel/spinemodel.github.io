The Spine Model ([read this for an intro to the model itself](documentation)), originated from the collaboration on organisational coaching work done by [Kevin Trethewey](http://www.twitter.com/kevintrethewey) and [Danie Roux](http://www.twitter.com/danieroux). Since then a number of people have collaborated and added ideas to the model, in various useful ways.

## Emergence of the Model
The Spine Model is an extension of Kent Beck's modeling of XP ideas as Values, Principles and Practices. We then added the way Needs where modeled in Marshall Rosenberg's Non-Violent Communication on top. We added Tools on the bottom because that made sense. 

That formed the basis of the Spine Model structure, but the thinking and the way we apply it has been influenced by many great minds, many of which are pictured below.

See more about [why it's called the *Spine* Model](why-spine-model) and [why it is drawn the way it is](why-spine-drawn-that-way).
