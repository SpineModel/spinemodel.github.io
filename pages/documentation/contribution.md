# Style Conventions
SpineModel.info has been developed with the following values, keep them in mind when contributing:

* *Precise* - Short, concise descriptions of various parts of Spine Models.
* *Simple* - Avoid jargon where plain language will do. 
* *Shallow* - Create a map, not an archive. Rather than duplicating content from other sources, add the relevant snippet and link to the source.
