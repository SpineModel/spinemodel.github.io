{% include tip.html content="Resolve the statement: *We optimise the system for {X}, so that meeting the Needs is more likely.*" %}

Values are the qualities we believe we should optimise for in order to meet the [Needs](/needs). They can be used as measuring sticks when deciding how to apply [Principles](/principles), or which path forward to take (eg. will X change give us more predictability or less?).

At a system level, if you have these things you are most likely to meet the Need. Secondly, at a personal level, these are the things that will keep me in the system because they will ensure that I meet my Needs.

For some examples of Values, see the [Values Catalogue](values-catalogue).
