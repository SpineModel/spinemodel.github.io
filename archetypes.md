> **Archetype (n):** The original pattern or model from which all things of the same kind are copied or on which they are based.

There are many patterns, models and frameworks for designing human work systems. These can be mapped using the Spine Model by extracting them into the five levels of a spine.

This makes them easier to understand and to start to compare to each other. It also makes them easier to use as a departure point from which to effectively evolve to suit your particular context.
